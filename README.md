My first Githuub Repository -- ooh-lala

This is a readme file that I will use to explain my project. The current project is my first time learning how to use git. 

Wikipedia says this about the history and classifications of README files.  

They are usually a plain text file and README is usually written in all caps. 

"A README file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called READ.ME, README.TXT,[1] README.md (for a text file using markdown markup), README.1ST – or simply README.

The file's name is generally written in uppercase letters. On Unix-like systems in particular this makes it easily noticed – both because lowercase filenames are more usual, and because traditionally the ls command sorts and displays files in ASCIIbetical ordering, so that uppercase filenames appear first.[nb 1]"   -- From Wikipedia
